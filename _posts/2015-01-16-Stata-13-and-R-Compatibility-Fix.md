My last post was regarding the installation of R on Ubuntu. That was not the beginnig though. My curriculum required using Stata, but ***Linux installer for the same was not available and I did not want to shift to Windows***. After a lot of googling stuff, I came to the conclusion that for a beginner in data analytics (like me), it does not matter much what you choose, though R has a steeper learning curve.

So, I decided to move forward with what was possible... installing R.

Now, the problem was, ***compatibility between R and STATA 13*** i.e , how to use datasets generated by/for STATA in R.
For ***STATA 12 and below***, R offers an official library called ***foreign*** which lets you import STATA datasets in R like this:

***library(foreign)***
***data <- read.dta("filename.dta")***

However, [this method](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/foreign/html/read.dta.html) will not be supported for STATA 13 and beyond. 
Luckily, a faculty at RUB has created an [open source package](https://github.com/sjewo/readstata13) that helps to import STATA 13 dataset into R.

To use this, first install ***devtools package in R***
Go to console in R and type
***install.packages("devtools", dependencies=T)***
Then
***devtools::install_github("sjewo/readstata13", ref="0.4")***

This will install the package in R. Now, in order to use it , you need to import it.
***library(readstata13)***

Then, this will work like a magic!!
***data <- read.dta13("filename.dta")***

Cheers!!

***UPDATE***:
I found a useful resource for people who are migrating from STATA to R or vice versa [http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf)
