This post was scheduled way back. But better late than never!

This summer, I had an opportunity to work for a startup ***[3DPhy.com](http://3dphy.com/)*** *a.k.a* ***Shulin Automation Pvt. Ltd.***. The team was a bunch of awesome coders, designers and product development people. I was hired to develop a python app which would help the team to *automate* data collection and processing (*yeah, it goes by the name*). Most of the work in this particular project, I had already done in bits and pieces in my earlier projects, so I completed it pretty fast. The next project that I worked on, exposed me to something entirely new, ***3D Graphics***.  I worked alongside the CTO (Mr. Sumandeep Banerjee) to develop a browser app that gives a *virtual 3D tour* of real estate properties. The basic product had already been developed and was to be made available to the users, that's where the *browser* comes into the picture.


I learnt about the [Graphics Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline) and an integral component of the project, [WebGl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). It is really interesting how we simulate real world physics with computers. 3D graphics on the web is relatively new and requires modern browsers and a good computer , preferably with a GPU. In most cases, a good WebGL app is CPU and memory intensive as well, therefore it is the responsibility of the coder not to waste the precious *CPU cycles* and take care of *caching*. The post will be incomplete without the mention of ***Javascript*** which was the heart and soul for this part of the project. I learnt about *[closures](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/)*, the *[evil this](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)* (*well it's not evil once you understand it completely*),*xml and json parsing* and used a bunch of javascript libraries. Ah! and how could I forget [callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/). There' some [good news in store related to callbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lil4YCCXRYc). I've come to *love Javascript* ever since. The good thing about using so many libraries(*opensource, of course*) is that you learn to write better code following the constructs of the library. I also learnt to [integrate apache and mod_wsgi](http://light94.github.io/2015/05/26/Making-Your-Django-App-Work-With-Apache-and-mod_wsgi/) for shipping django apps to production.

To sum up, I must say that the internship was a great learning experience and I look forward to similar positions in future.

P.S  The product to which I contributed can be seen on the [company website](http://3dphy.com/).
