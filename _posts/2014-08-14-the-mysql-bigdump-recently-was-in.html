<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b></b>&nbsp;I recently was in a situation when I had to push code for a new website to my server. Simple enough, except that I could not access the <b>phpmyadmin </b>by remote or local method. (Local method means accessing phpmyadmin installed on the hosting server itself, whereas remote method means using phpmyadmin on your own system ,for eg. i had it installed as part of wamp, to access the mysql database of remote server.)<br /><br />There were large queries to be made and i didn't want to type it all on the console. It was at this time that i came across&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/" target="_blank">bigdump script</a>&nbsp;. What it actually does , is that it excutes your mysql dump( usually generated by an export of your database). That is, it <b>imports </b>a database to the server.It is a very good script made specially for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/you-want/" target="_blank">problems like this</a>&nbsp;.<br /><br />The steps involved are as follows,<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Create a folder(let its name be <b>dump).</b></li><li>Transfer the <b>bigdump.php </b>and the <b>dumped sql file </b>in that folder.</li><li>On your browser, enter the path to the script.</li><li>The script will ask your permission to run the queries in database.</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>The script itself is customizable. Few things to be kept it mind,</div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>You need to change database login credentials in the script.</li><li>If the dump contains <b>CREATE DATABASE </b>&nbsp;query, we need to uncomment a line in the script.</li></ol><div><br /></div></div><div>With these things in mind, bigdump turns out to be a very useful tool</div></div>
