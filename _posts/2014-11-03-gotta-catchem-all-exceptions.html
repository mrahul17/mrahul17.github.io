<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So, I was recently doing a webscraping project. I had a database of people and I had to lookup and confirm their identity. Identity in the sense that they had either studied or taught in my college. The task can be done manually for a small set, but I had 7000 records!!<div><br /></div><div>So I used <b>xgoogle</b> for this purpose. It is a Python Library for Google Search.</div><div>Now, after having completed the task, I can name a <b>minimum 7 exceptions</b> that can occur when you automate web lookups. They are :</div><div><b>SearchError </b>(class in xgoogle that handles exceptions raised by google during searches)</div><div><b>HTTPError &nbsp;(</b>generally raised when there is some error in authentication, like trying to access a secured page of an organization, or when the url is <b>http when it really should be https</b>)</div><div><b>URLError </b>(being a subclass of OSError, this error is related to system related problems like input/output . This includes error in fetching data from a url)</div><div><b>SocketError </b>(Raised when there is some issue with the server eg. overload, throttle)</div><div><b>ValueError </b>(Raised when the required datatype conversion is not permitted)</div><div><b>IncompleteRead </b>(When the server closes the connection before the chunk of data has benn fully retireved.)</div><div><b>BadStatusLine </b>(Raised when we request a webpage, and the server responds with a code that Python cannot understand)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Well this is not the complete list.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had to automate the task in such a way &nbsp;that I start the code before going to bed and I get it completed when I wake up. So, I decided to <b>catch all :</b></div><div><br /></div><div><b><i>try:</i></b></div><div><b><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; my code</i></b></div><div><b><i>except KeyBoardInterrupt:</i></b></div><div><b><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; raise</i></b></div><div><b><i>except:</i></b></div><div><i><b>&nbsp;</b>#handles all exceptions except KeyBoardInterrupt</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>This piece of code will ensure that unless you manually try to end your code, it will not stop.</div><div><b><i><br /></i></b></div></div>
