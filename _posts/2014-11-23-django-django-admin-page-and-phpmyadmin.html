<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have been developing web apps for quite some time in Django. I would like to discuss here some things which might not have struck you while developing with Django.<br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Django</b> comes with a inbuilt admin page, Once you <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial02/#customize-the-admin-index-page" target="_blank">register your model in admin.py</a>&nbsp;, you are set to use the admin page for adding /deleting records in your database.However you might feel constrained by the functionality which this admin page provides, as I did. Since I come from a PHP background, &nbsp;I badly missed <b>phpmyadmin</b> and its rich features. It feels quite strange to see &nbsp;PHP and Python associated (it did for me).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; One thing is for sure,<b> to run phpmyadmin, you need a server that supports PHP</b>. So, first of all you need to know that you need to have your <b>wamp/xampp/lamp </b>server running in order to access the database. <b>The default ip for wamp is 127.0.0.0 and that for django inbuilt server is 127.0.0.1 </b>, so running both of them would never be a problem. Now you need to configure the <b>settings.py file </b>inside of your project with the database details like<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql'</b><br />and change the username,password etc. to access the database. <b>Don't forget to run manage,py syncdb after this.</b>&nbsp; Now, how to make phpmyadmin notice this?<br /><br /><b>Head over to config.inc.php in htdocs directory of your wamp installation and provide the connection details to the django built in server in the manner it has been done for the apache server above . Remember to put the $i++ before the configuration details.</b><br /><b><br /></b><b><br /></b>Now, restart apache and go to phpmyadmin. You will get an option to select beween the 2 servers. Choose <b>127.0.0.1 (django) </b>and you will find the database sitting right there.<br /><br />The bad thing about this is:<br /><b>You cannot modify the database structure. You can only add/update/delete records from the database.</b><b>&nbsp;There must be a tool for overriding this, so I will update later!!</b></div></div>
