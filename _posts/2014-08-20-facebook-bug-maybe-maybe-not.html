<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Recently, I was fiddling around with things and found something which according to me seems a <b>bug</b>, but is not according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;.<br /><br />So what I found that, the visibility/ privacy settings as in this picture can be overruled.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nm334gf20x0/U_OZM1ye3_I/AAAAAAAAFg0/Y6ORw-nMqCU/s1600/fb2.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="fb privacy" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nm334gf20x0/U_OZM1ye3_I/AAAAAAAAFg0/Y6ORw-nMqCU/s1600/fb2.PNG" title="Profile Picture Privacy setting" /></a><br /><br /><br />I have tried reporting this to the Facebook team and according to them this is no security bug, so I can safely post my report over here.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So, I was using the <b><span style="color: white;">developer tools</span></b> provided in <b><span style="color: white;">Google Chrome</span>. </b>&nbsp;I asked my friend to change privacy setting of his profile picture such that all except me could see his image. <b>Note: </b>while a profile picture is visible to all when someone visits a person's profile, they only see the cropped portion of the profile picture. <b><span style="color: white;">Only the people granted access can click on it</span> to see the complete picture</b>. Of course, this is what <b>facebook</b> claims or maybe we have deduced it incorrectly.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I used the DOM inspector to find the unique url of the profile picture as in the picture below<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_wQq19xtjY/U_ObhDBU6VI/AAAAAAAAFhQ/Rzh3QErO5wc/s1600/bug1.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_wQq19xtjY/U_ObhDBU6VI/AAAAAAAAFhQ/Rzh3QErO5wc/s1600/bug1.PNG" height="51" width="640" /></a></div><br />So, the unique url is the portion that i have scribbled with blank <b>(:P)</b>&nbsp;.<br /><br />I copied this url. Now, I went to my own account, and clicked on the profile picture. Again using the DOM inspector, I found the common url. It turned out to be this (the part which is not scribbled):<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4QjzI3Xb1N4/U_ObXvRZQII/AAAAAAAAFhM/hyTiXTc3AAo/s1600/bug2.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4QjzI3Xb1N4/U_ObXvRZQII/AAAAAAAAFhM/hyTiXTc3AAo/s1600/bug2.PNG" height="23" width="640" /></a></div><b><span style="color: white;">I then replaced the scribbled part of this url with the scribbled part of the previous image.</span></b><br /><b><br /></b>&nbsp;And the result was, I could see the profile picture of my friend, not only the cropped part,<b> the whole picture. </b>Also going into incognito mode, I could still see it.<br /><br /><br />So according to me, this is incorrect and as mentioned above I reported this to facebook <b>twice. </b>But it seems I am wrong.. I'd like to hear your comments on this :)<br /><br /><b>EDIT:</b><br />Facebook offers an API to see the images as in&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/photo/" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;. However, the point to be noted there is :<br /><br /><h3 id="readperms" style="background-color: white; color: #4e5665; font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; margin: 40px 0px 20px; padding: 0px;">Permissions</h3><ul style="background-color: white; color: #4e5665; font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; list-style-type: none; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 40px;"><li style="list-style: disc;">Any valid access token for any photo with<b> public privacy settings.</b></li><li style="list-style: disc;">For any photos uploaded by someone, and any photos in which they have been tagged - A user access token for that person with&nbsp;<code style="color: #46a800; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Courier New', monospace;">user_photos</code>&nbsp;permission.</li><li></li></ul></div>
