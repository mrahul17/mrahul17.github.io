<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It's a day before the endsemester exams and I can't help thinking about how the ERP team evaluates my feedback about professors. 10,000 + students. One obvious way which I can think of is- It gets a overall rating of each teacher. If the overall rating is good enough, I don't think they worry about the suggestion. If there is a poor rating, they would manually take some random suggestions (if they take at all).<br /><br />Improper and inefficient I would say (if at all this is the process).<br /><br />I am thinking of using <b>Python's Natural Language Toolkit</b> for this purpose. I will look for words like <b>"good" "bad" "should" </b>and get their context like <b>"good at *" "bad at *" "should do *"</b>. Similar suggestions (a group of students giving similar suggestions) would be forwarded to the teacher to improve the classroom experience. Further updates after the endsem.</div>
