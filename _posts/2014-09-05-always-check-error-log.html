<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b>5 hours </b>trying to debug a very simple problem.. I've learned my lesson.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Always check the error log</blockquote><br />I cannot emphasize this point more, it can save you lots of time. That's why it is there!<br /><br />So, I made a web app in Codeigniter framework. All the development took place on my windows computer. Everything went perfect, web app fully functional in on localhost. Then i decided to launch it, on a Linux server (<b>Ubuntu </b>to be precise). I configured the database settings and started the server. The web app uses a login on its first page itself . It displayed the form correctly. I entered the login id and password only to be met b a <b>blank </b>page .I have been greeted many a times by <b>404</b> pages, but this was a new guest. A frequent user of web developer console, I quickly found out that it was a <b>500 Internal Server Problem. </b>After a google search i found that it happens because of some <b>programming&nbsp; </b>issue on the page/site. This was the first time I thought google was wrog, and this thougt was not baseless.. the same app was running perfectly on my PC. So , i searched&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17006340/codeigniter-web-app-is-not-working-with-the-linux-but-here-on-windows-is-fine" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://ellislab.com/forums/viewthread/124792/#617664" target="_blank">there</a> and <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/issues/1805" target="_blank">everywhere</a> (:P) . Tried everything , no perfect solution.<br /><br />Then i posted this question on Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25675750/naming-convention-issues-when-using-codeigniter-in-windows-and-linux/25676012#25676012" target="_blank">here</a> . What i need was just 1 comment (thanks @Prix) .<br />My error log just threw the syntax error on my face. I was bewildered . Why?<br />Again google. I found that the code i had written took help of a feature that had been introduced in PHP 5.4 while my server was running PHP 5.2 . The feature is called&nbsp; <b>function array dereferencing. </b>It means accessing the array values at a particular index, the array being returned by a function. It meant that i had <b>to use a temporary variable to store the returned value of the array ad then access array index from it</b> .<br /><br />Obviously the other solution was to use PHP 5.4 But to my dismay, the truth was that PHP 5.4 repos are not available for ubuntu 12.04. So i followed the instructions&nbsp; <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/343560/update-server-php-version-to-5-4-10-via-the-command-line" target="_blank">here</a> . However it did not work and i am still using php 5.2, but without issues. </div>
